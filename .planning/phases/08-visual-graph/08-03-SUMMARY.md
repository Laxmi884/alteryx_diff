  - "[08-03]: test_hierarchical_layout asserts pos[801] < pos[802] (not equality) — layout positions are computed floats; direction check is robust to scaling changes"

# Phase 8 Plan 03: GraphRenderer Test Suite Summary

**8-test suite validates all GRPH requirements: self-contained HTML fragment, hierarchical and canvas layouts, 5-category color mapping, diff panel elements, and HTMLRenderer graph embedding**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-06T20:18:27Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-06T20:30:14Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created `tests/fixtures/graph.py` with 6 DiffResult fixtures (ToolIDs 801-815): EMPTY_DIFF, ADDED_DIFF, REMOVED_DIFF, MODIFIED_DIFF, CONN_CHANGED_DIFF, ALL_CHANGE_TYPES_DIFF — plus ALL_NODES_OLD/NEW/CONNECTIONS tuple helpers for comprehensive rendering tests
- Created `tests/test_graph_renderer.py` with 8 tests covering all GRPH requirements: self-containment (no CDN), fragment structure (no html/body), 5-category color mapping, unique node count, hierarchical layout with directional assertion, canvas layout coordinate passthrough, diff panel structure, HTMLRenderer graph_html embedding
- Full suite: 93 passed, 1 xfailed (85 existing + 8 new) — zero regressions
- ruff check clean on both test files and all renderers; mypy clean on src/alteryx_diff/renderers/ (5 files)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create tests/fixtures/graph.py** - `190ef72` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Write tests/test_graph_renderer.py (8 tests)** - `f7c1beb` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `tests/fixtures/graph.py` — Module-level DiffResult fixtures with ToolIDs 801-815; _node() builder; EMPTY_DIFF, ADDED_DIFF, REMOVED_DIFF, MODIFIED_DIFF, CONN_CHANGED_DIFF, ALL_CHANGE_TYPES_DIFF; ALL_NODES_OLD/NEW/CONNECTIONS tuple helpers
- `tests/test_graph_renderer.py` — 8 test functions with _extract_graph_nodes() helper; covers GRPH-01 through GRPH-04 comprehensively

## Decisions Made

- `ADDED_DIFF`, `REMOVED_DIFF`, `MODIFIED_NODE_DIFF` kept in fixtures file for future use but not imported in test file (ruff F401 prevents unused imports in test files)
- `_extract_graph_nodes()` uses first `]` after the `var GRAPH_NODES = ` marker — reliable because GRAPH_NODES is a flat array of objects with no nested arrays in the current template
- `test_hierarchical_layout_produces_positions` asserts `pos[801] < pos[802]` (directional inequality) rather than exact values — robust to future LAYOUT_SCALE changes
- `AlteryxNode` constructors in `test_canvas_layout_uses_alteryx_coordinates` split to multi-line form to satisfy ruff E501 88-char line limit

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Removed unused imports flagged by ruff F401**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (commit attempt)
- **Issue:** Plan's import list in the test file snippet included `ADDED_DIFF`, `REMOVED_DIFF`, `MODIFIED_NODE_DIFF`, and `AnchorName` — none used in any test function; ruff F401 blocks commit
- **Fix:** Removed the 4 unused imports from the test file import block; kept all fixtures in `graph.py` for downstream use
- **Files modified:** `tests/test_graph_renderer.py`
- **Verification:** `ruff check tests/test_graph_renderer.py` — All checks passed
- **Committed in:** `f7c1beb` (Task 2 commit)

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed E501 line-length violations in test file**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (ruff check pre-commit)
- **Issue:** Comment lines (node IDs) and AlteryxNode constructors exceeded 88 chars; ruff E501 cannot auto-fix comments
- **Fix:** Shortened comment lines by abbreviating "(unchanged)" to "(unch)"; split AlteryxNode constructors to multi-line calls
- **Files modified:** `tests/test_graph_renderer.py`
- **Verification:** `ruff check tests/test_graph_renderer.py` — All checks passed
- **Committed in:** `f7c1beb` (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (both Rule 1 — import/style issues in test file)
**Impact on plan:** No scope change — all 8 planned test behaviors are implemented and passing.

## Issues Encountered

- ruff-format pre-commit hook reformatted `tests/fixtures/graph.py` on first commit attempt (long lines on NODE_MODIFIED_OLD/NEW and ALL_NODES_OLD/NEW tuple literals). Re-staged the reformatted file — same pattern documented in Plan 02 for graph_renderer.py.
- ruff check in Task 2 caught unused imports and E501 violations copied from the plan's code snippet; fixed inline before re-committing.

## User Setup Required

None — no external services, CDN, or manual configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 9 CLI can import `GraphRenderer`, `HTMLRenderer` from `alteryx_diff.renderers` with full test coverage backing all GRPH requirements
- All 4 GRPH requirements (GRPH-01 through GRPH-04) are now demonstrably tested and passing
- `tests/fixtures/graph.py` provides `ADDED_DIFF`, `REMOVED_DIFF`, `CONN_CHANGED_DIFF` fixtures not yet used in tests — available for CLI integration tests in Phase 9
