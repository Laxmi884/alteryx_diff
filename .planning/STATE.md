# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** Accurate detection of functional changes — zero false positives from layout noise, zero missed configuration changes.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Scaffold and Data Models

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Scaffold and Data Models)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (phase complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Plan 01-03 complete: 21-test model acceptance gate; pytest exits 0, mypy --strict exits 0; Phase 1 complete

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 11% (3/27 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 13 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-scaffold-and-data-models | 3 | 13 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6 min), 01-02 (4 min), 01-03 (3 min)
- Trend: —

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-scaffold-and-data-models P03 | 3 | 1 tasks | 1 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Python 3.11+ required (NetworkX 3.6.1 hard constraint) — do not target 3.10
- [Roadmap]: NodeMatcher built in Phase 4 before any diff logic — ToolID phantom pair risk is HIGH recovery cost if shipped wrong
- [Roadmap]: pyvis CDN spike scheduled as first plan of Phase 8 before committing to pyvis vs D3.js
- [Roadmap]: CLI built last (Phase 9) as thin Typer adapter — pipeline.run() is the only entry point for all stages
- [01-01]: Used Python 3.13 in .python-version (not 3.11) — 3.13.7 installed locally, satisfies >=3.11, avoids uv python download
- [01-01]: pre-commit mypy hook restricted to src/ only (files: ^src/) — isolated hook env cannot resolve project package imports in tests/
- [01-01]: Added tests/test_import.py smoke test — pytest exits code 5 with zero tests, plan requires exit 0
- [01-02]: All 6 dataclasses use frozen=True, kw_only=True, slots=True — immutability, explicit construction, memory efficiency
- [01-02]: AlteryxNode.config is dict[str, Any] with field(default_factory=dict) — flat map; raw XML not in model layer
- [01-02]: WorkflowDoc collections (nodes, connections) are tuple[T, ...] — immutable, compatible with frozen=True
- [01-02]: AlteryxNode is topology-free; all connections stored on WorkflowDoc
- [Phase 01-03]: Used direct attribute assignment (not object.__setattr__) to test FrozenInstanceError — with slots=True, object.__setattr__ bypasses frozen enforcement

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Alteryx XML format assumptions (TempFile element structure, GUID field names, position XPath) need validation against real .yxmd files in Phase 3 fixture tests — inferred from community sources, not Alteryx official docs
- [Phase 8]: pyvis Bootstrap CDN leak confirmed (issue #228) but post-processing workaround implementation details unverified — spike required before committing graph approach

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-01
Stopped at: Completed 01-03-PLAN.md — 21-test model acceptance gate; pytest exits 0, mypy --strict exits 0; Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2 (parser)
Resume file: None
