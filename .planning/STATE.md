## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Python 3.11+ required (NetworkX 3.6.1 hard constraint) — do not target 3.10
- [Roadmap]: NodeMatcher built in Phase 4 before any diff logic — ToolID phantom pair risk is HIGH recovery cost if shipped wrong
- [Roadmap]: pyvis CDN spike scheduled as first plan of Phase 8 before committing to pyvis vs D3.js
- [Roadmap]: CLI built last (Phase 9) as thin Typer adapter — pipeline.run() is the only entry point for all stages

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Alteryx XML format assumptions (TempFile element structure, GUID field names, position XPath) need validation against real .yxmd files in Phase 3 fixture tests — inferred from community sources, not Alteryx official docs
- [Phase 8]: pyvis Bootstrap CDN leak confirmed (issue #228) but post-processing workaround implementation details unverified — spike required before committing graph approach
